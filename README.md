## Concept: CSS

### Section: Context 
Though a little advanced, we are still in the basic web design class, where we may chage the colors, add borders, change backgrounds,change fonts, use hex and rbg codes, and more. It is an overview of coding style. I was somewhat familiar with CSS since we learned about it last year as well, but the new kinds of styles that were new to us confused me a little. 

#### Basics I learned: 
* `color: red;`changes color to red 
* `font-size: 16px;` gives a font size of 16 px.
* `font-family: monospace;`changed the font to monospace
* `border-color: green;` gives a border with the color green.
* `border-width: 10px;` changes the width of the border to 10px.
* `border-style: solid;` gives a solid border (there could be dotted and dashed borders). 
* `border-radius: 10px;` changes the shape of the border and makes it more round (like a circle).
* `margin: 20px;` the space around an element's border, so for this the margin is 20px (space outside) 
* `padding: 20px;` the space between an element's border and the element's content, the padding is 20px (space inside) 
* `background-color: #000000;` hex codes are for specific colors, #000000 is the color black ( letters and numbers in hex codes) 
* `background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);`rbg is another way for specific colors using red, green and blue ( only numbers ) rgb(0, 0, 0) = black rgb(255, 255, 255) = white
   

#### Process: 
Similar to how I learned about HTML, I learnt CSS by first going over the first few [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org/) lessons.The first few lessons covered the basics, including `colors`, `fonts`, `boders`, `sizes`, and other elements. We were required to create a [CSS Make Something](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm2m6o8x07znlpuunw5afu306) similar to the "HTML Make Something" in order to further our understanding and practice of the essentials. All I did was add CSS to my HTML project.
